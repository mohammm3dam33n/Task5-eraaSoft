why echo is faster?

 When you are using loops, of course, php checks if echo has multiple values to print or not,
 but always print can take only one parameter and it's not needed to be checked in loops. 
also when there are multiple values for echo bad things come through,
 like converting them to string and streaming them,
 I do believe that in huge hypertexts these problem come through too because you are forcing php to process before printing.
 But in small jobs like printing, only a small string echo I good (if you consider concatenations) because it doesn't return anything like print.
