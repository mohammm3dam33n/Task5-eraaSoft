echo vs print?

The main difference between the print and echo statement is that echo does not behave like a function whereas print behaves like a function. 

The print statement can have only one argument at a time and thus can print a single string

echo allows you to pass multiple strings when using it as if it were a function (e.g., echo($var1, $var2, $var3)).

As far as which is faster, there are many online resources that attempt to answer that question.

 The one small thing to notice is that when using a comma to separate items whilst using the echo function, items run slightly faster."

It will really come down to your preference, since the differences in speed (whatever they actually are) are negligible.
